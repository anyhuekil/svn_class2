<hr />
<p>Such a feeling's coming over me.<br/>
There is wonder in most every thing I see.<br/>
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes.<br/>
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream.</p>
<p>Everything I want the world to be is 
now coming true especially for me.<br/>
And the reason is clear. <br/>
It's because you are here.<br/>
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen.</p>
<p>I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation.<br/>
And the only explanation I can find is the love, <br/>
that I've found ever since you've been around.<br/>
Your love's put me at the top of the world.</p>

<p>Something in the wind has learned my name.<br/>
And it's telling me that things are not the same.<br/>
In the leaves, on the trees and the touch of the breeze.<br/>
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me.</p>
<p>There is only one wish on my mind.<br/>
When this day is through, I hope that I will find,<br/>
that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me.<br/>
All I need will be mine if you are here.</p>
